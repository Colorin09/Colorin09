- 👋 Hi, I’m Alexandra Mormontoy, aka. @Colorin09. I am a programmer-analyst graduate.
- 👀 I’m interested in gaining experience as a programmer, reading more about science-fiction and other
    hobbies as astrology and arts.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about React.js and Android development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to create some projects I had in mind for a while and try to actively participate in 
  CS communities as ReactFlow and StackOverFlow.
